        <item>As the centre of European culture and institutions, Brussels has much more to offer than most people imagine. Apart from its famous chocolates and beers.
            <br/>Belgium\'s fascinating capital, and the administrative capital of the EU, Brussels is historic yet hip, bureaucratic yet bizarre, self confident yet unshowy, and multicultural to its roots.
            <br/>All this plays out in a cityscape that swings from majestic to quirky to rundown and back again.
            <br/>Organic art nouveau facades face off against 1960s concrete developments, and regal 19th-century mansions contrast with the brutal glass of the EU’\s Gotham City.
            <br/>This whole maelstrom swirls out from Brussels’\ medieval core, where the Grand Place is surely one of the world’\s most beautiful squares.</item>
        <item>Brussels airport is fairy close to the city center. The distance is 12 kilometres (7 miles) and the fastest travelling time is an 18 minute drive.
            <br/>However, since Brussels is a busy European city, you really should have a time reserve and make proper travel research beforehand.
            <br/>There is a train going from Brussels Zaventem Airport to Brussels Central Station every 10 minutes between 5am and midnight, 7 days a week.
            <br/>The ride takes 18 minutes and costs €12,70. However you will need to deal with public transport from the central station to your hotel.
            <br/>If you think you will not like that after a flight then consider the taxi option below.</item>
        <item>If you’re spending some time in Belgium, whether in the Brussels-Capital Region or in outlying cities, you can find accommodations to fit your needs, taste and budget.
            <br/>You can find a bed in a Brussels hostel for around €17 - €25 per night. There are hostels located 15 minutes walk from the main square, but many are further away.
            <br/>Therefore make sure to look at the map too. Hostel atmosphere is quite friendly and it is a very good place to meet fellow travellers.
            <br/>Many people who travel on their own like to sit in the common room during the evening and chat. Or even plan their sightseeing together.</item>
        <item>Tourist bus is a comfortable way of sightseeing without getting tired from managing the whole tour.
            <br/>It costs €32 for 48 hours and covers most Brussels attractions. Many people choose to do the whole circle around city first.
            <br/>To look around, listen to audioguide (in most world languages) and after that hop off to see the attractions.
            <br/>The Brussels hop-on hop-off bus goes around the city and stops at famous attractions.
            <br/>You can get off-board, check out the attraction and continue the route by getting on another bus whenever you feel like it.</item>
        <item>For travelers who prefer to see the sights rather than bury their nose in a travel guide. there are guided sightseeing and topic tours available all over Brussels.
            <br/>Most of them have multi-lingual guides available who speak English, French, German, Dutch, Russian and Arabic.
            <br/>Private tours for only your friends or relatives are also available.Brussels beer tasting tour.

            <br/>Laid with some of the freshest fish and seafood in the city and sprinkled with Mer du Nord’s house tartare sauce.
            <br/>The best strategy here is to order several smaller plates and share them around.
            <br/>The prawns are to die for, while the kibbeling – deep-fried slices of Atlantic cod – is a signature delicacy you shouldn’t miss out on.</item>
        <item>Perched on a narrow street on the way from the Eglise Notre-Dame de la Chapelle to the flea market at Jeu de Balle.
            <br/>L’Idiot du Village looks like one of the many antique shops that surround it.
            <br/>Colorful, quirky and irresistibly charming, with pieces of vintage furniture.
            <br/>Accessories strewn around the room as if on an erratic whim.
            <br/>L’Idiot offers a truly unique dining experience in the heart of the Marolles.
            <br/>The food is less unorthodox than the decor, but by no means boring; the primarily French menu changes every season.
            <br/>Some of the most exciting delicacies in the past have included the roast pigeon served with artichoke risotto, or the foie gras terrine with a beet and cuberdon jelly.</item>
        <item>Au Vieux Bruxelles has been standing in the heart of St. Boniface since 1882.
            <br/>We can easily claim the title of the most Bruxellois restaurant in the area.
            <br/>Its charm is due to its simplicity, where wood-paneled walls, chequered table covers.
            <br/>Countless memorabilia scattered around the room transport diners to another era.
            <br/>Expect to see the best of traditional Brussels fare on the menu, from the Gueuze beer carbonnade with chips.
            <br/>Or the waterzooi chicken stew and some of the best moules frites (mussels with chips) in town.
            <br/>However, be careful not to miss Au Vieux Bruxelles while walking by.
            <br/>The tumbledown exterior and plastic chairs set on the street outside do a great job at camouflaging this hidden gem of a restaurant</item>

        <item>With an intimist, mysterious and romantic atmosphere, this place is the closest venue you could compare to the state of mind of "Amélie Poulain".
            <br/>You feel like you\'re at home, sitting on couches even more comfortable than yours.
            <br/>What might be different is the occasional bicycle that is hanging from the ceiling or the family portraits that overlap each other on the walls.
            <br/>The Goupil le Fol is like a bar within a house; or a house within a bar? Weird, but well done.</item>
        <item>For more than 35 years, this is the most unusual meeting place around Grand Place.
            <br/>A mortuary chamber, all dressed in black, as it should be, with real coffins serving as tables.
            <br/>This bar, far from being morbid, was at first frequented by the Brussels youth.
            <br/>Then by the tourists who made this very special place one of their favorite landmarks.</item>
        <item>Kafka is just perfect for starting - or indeed finishing - the night off on a gentle note.
            <br/>Despite stocking enough varieties of vodka and national beer to sink a fleet of battle ships.
            <br/>The decor is traditional. Oaken tables, oaken bar, old piano in the corner, panelled booths, a spiral staircase.
            <br/>It is all a welcome corrective to the tired formulae of the modernist.</item>
        <item>Smack bang in the middle of the lively cluster of bars and restaurants on Rue St-Boniface.
            <br/>This brasserie has rapidly become a firm favourite among locals.
            <br/>Serving a large array of excellent artisanal beers, a wine list that\'s particularly strong on French reds and a solid menu of Belgian classics.
            <br/>It attracts a young, if rather eclectic crowd, and has a welcoming, appealing atmosphere.
            <br/>it\'s a place you\'ll want to return to again and again.</item>
        <item>Café Belga is housed in the former offices of the national radio and television office.
            <br/>This place is like an institution for some people in Brussels who frequent Place Flagey on a daily basis.
            <br/>This is probably the most frequent bar in Place Flagey.
            <br/>It does not matter that this silk morning, noon or evening, you will find your happiness. Between breakfast, Sunday morning brunch, or after-work drink, Belga will delight you.</item>
        <item>Enjoying a 17th century location at the very heart of Brussels, only a few metres away from the legendary Grand’Place.
            <br/>The Music Village has opened its doors on the 1st of September 2000.
            <br/>With acoustics, sound system, lighting, stage, warm welcome, comfort, and food &amp; drink that live up to the most prestigious clubs of New-York and London.
            <br/>The Music Village offers all music fans, listeners and musicians alike, a return to the Golden Age of international jazz clubs.</item>
        <item>In the sixteenth century, the vaulted space currently occupied by the Black Gate, constituted the kitchens of the convent of the Alexians.
            <br/>We can still see a well and a cooler that served the sisters to cook and keep food.
            <br/>The Black Gate is now a place where, in the atmosphere, the products sold and the spirit of the bartenders.
            <br/>We find a Celtic and medieval side that suits so well to its vaults.</item>
        <item>Located in the district of La Cambre, Etiquette is a bar wine not quite like the others.
            <br/>Here is self-service! Thanks to a prepaid magnetic card, one chooses his wine and the desired quantity (3, 6 or 12 cl).
            <br/>More than 50 bottles are waiting for us wisely behind a window, kept at a good temperature and kept with nitrogen.
            <br/>The opportunity to test many different wines without (too much) ruin.</item>
        <item>Notice to fans of surreal atmosphere and retro decor, you will be served.
            <br/>Immersed in another century, flasks and jars of formalin are inspected with a cocktail of Hendrick\'s gin.
            <br/>Here, beverages are real elixirs that you enjoy with your eyes closed.
            <br/>A barred universe, a real cabinet of curiosities to discover at least once, change of scenery guaranteed.</item>
        <item>On the border with the artsy Sainte-Catherine area.
            <br/>Monk Bar is the place to go if you’re looking for a spacious yet intimate bar with some style.

        <item>Grand-Place, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the main tourist attraction of the City of Brussels but its beginnings were less than glamourous.
            <br/>The area was just a swampy sand-bank between two brooks, known as ‘broek sella’ which gave Brussels its name.
            <br/>The sand bank was reclaimed and turned into ‘Niedermerckt’ (lower market) and sold French and English textiles, French wines and German beer.
            <br/>In the Middle Ages wooden houses were built around the market.
            <br/>By the 14th century wealthy families took to building stone mansions which led to the market developing into the main commercial administrative centre.
            <br/>The town hall came in 1402 and by now it was also a political centre.
            <br/>This is where dukes, royalty and emperors were received but the square was also the site of executions.
            <br/>Today the Grand-Place is a beautiful, wide open cobbled medieval and is Brussels’ main market square.
            <br/>It is a great place to hang out and admire the elegant guildhouses which replaced all the wooden homes.
            <br/>Many have admired its beauty including Victor Hugo and Baudelaire who rhapsodised about its charm and appealing looks.
            <br/>There is a daily flower market between March and October and often accompanied with concerts and a light show in the evening.
            <br/>Every two years, during the third week of August (next one will take place 16-19 August 2018), Belgian begonia cultivators decorate the Grand-Place with a beautiful flower carpet using around 750,000 begonias.
            <br/>Visitors are greeted with 3,200 square feet of amazing plant tapestry depicting a theme.
            <br/>The square is where daily business is done and where a flurry of local bars and cafés are a superb example of top quality café culture.</item>
        <item>Heysel park, located in the west of Brussels, is dedicated to recreation and leisure.
            <br/>One of the highlights of the park is the Atomium.
            <br/>The Atomium is a monument in Brussels, Belgium, built on the occasion of the 1958 World Fair and representing the conventional mesh of iron crystal enlarged 165 billion times.
            <br/>The Atomium was designed by the engineer André Waterkeyn and erected by the architects André and Jean Polak for the 1958 World Fair in Brussels, Belgium.
            <br/>It is a building halfway between sculpture and architecture that rises to 102 m.
            <br/>Its structural steel weighs 2,400 tons.
            <br/>Like the Manneken Pis and the Grand Place, it has become a symbol of Belgium\'s capital.
            <br/>It consists of a steel frame with nine spheres interconnected and originally coated with aluminum.
            <br/>The spheres have a diameter of 18 meters and weigh approximately 250 tons each.
            <br/>Symbolically, the Atomium embodies the audacity of an era that wanted to confront the destiny of humanity with scientific discoveries.
            <br/>The construction of the Atomium was a technical feat.
            <br/>Of the nine spheres, six are open to the public, each with two main floors and a lower floor reserved for service.
            <br/>The central tube contains the fastest elevator of the time (5 m / s) installed by the Belgian branch of the Swiss firm Schlieren (later taken over by Schindler).
            <br/>It allows 22 people to reach the top in 23 seconds.
            <br/>The escalators installed in the oblique tubes are among the longest in Europe. The largest is 35 m long.</item>
        <item>The Parc du Cinquantenaire or Jubelpark is not only a park but a national landmark in Brussels.
            <br/>The name means \'Park of the fiftieth anniversary\' and it was built during the reign of Leopold II to commemorate fifty years of Belgian independence.
            <br/>Symbolically, the Cinquantenaire Park in Brussels is built in the shape of a pentagon, like the inner and outer rings of the city.
            <br/>Cinquantenaire sits just outside the inner circle, and is close to the European Quarter.
            <br/>At the south eastern point of the park is a giant arch with two arms extending out.
            <br/>It is quite a monumental entrance.
            <br/>The two arms of the arch are home to three museums: The Autoworld, an art museum and an army museum.
            <br/>Visitors can climb to the top of the arch for free from an entrance in the army museum to see a nice view of Brussels and European Quarter.
            <br/>On a clear day, you will be able to see far and wide.
            <br/>What locals know is that the entire area is populated with international people working among European institutions and large corporations, which have offices in Brussels.
            <br/>In order to keep everyone entertained throughout the year this Brussels park plays host to an endless number of events.
            <br/>Concerts, club nights, festivals, drive-through-cinemas, environmental days, aperitifs, and even the starting line to Brussels marathons.</item>
        <item>The Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula or ‘Collegiale Sint-Michiels- en Sint-Goedele-co-kathedraal’ in Dutch was given cathedral status in 1962.
            <br/>The patron saints Michael and Gudula are also the patrons of the city of Brussels, which is where the cathedral is located.
            <br/>Its history goes as back as the 9th or even the 8th century, when sources believe that a chapel was built to honour St. Michael on the Treurenberg Hill.
            <br/>However, two centuries later, Duke of Brabant, Lambert II had a Romanesque church built in its place.
            <br/>In 1047, the relics of the martyr St. Gudula were transported here from the Saint Gaugericus Church on Saint-Géry Island.
            <br/>Thus the cathedral became of two patron saints: Michael and Gudula and so did the city of Brussels.
            <br/>In the beginning of the 13th century, Henry I, Duke of Brabant commissioned the restoration of the cathedral, adding two round towers to it.
            <br/>In 1226, his successor Henri II ordered the renovation of the church.
            <br/>The period coincided with the appearance of the Gothic style and so the Gothic collegiate church came to be almost 300 years later.
            <br/>The cathedral was completed right before the reign of the emperor Charles V in 1519.
            <br/>Saint Michael is the Guardian of the Catholic Church and, as mentioned earlier, also the patron saint of Brussels ever since the Middle Ages.
            <br/>In Catholic writings, Saint Michael the Archangel is the defender of the Church, fighting Satan and helping lost souls in their final hours.</item>
        <item>The earliest mention of the existence of Manneken Pis can be found in an administrative text, dating from 1451–1452, about the water lines supplying the fountains of Brussels.
            <br/>From the beginning, the fountain played an essential role in the distribution of drinking water.
            <br/>It stood on a column and poured water into a double rectangular basin of stone.
            <br/>The only representations of this first statue can be found, very schematically, in a painting by Denis Van Alsloot, representing the Brussels\' Ommegang of 1615 and in a preparatory drawing to this painting.
            <br/>Towards the end of the 17th century, the statue became more and more important in the city life.
            <br/>It was also a survivor of the bombardment of Brussels in 1695.
            <br/>Manneken-Pis became a precious good and enjoys a ceaselessly growing glory.
            <br/>During big events, we adorn him with luxurious clothes.
            <br/>We know that in the 18th century, Manneken-Pis was dressed at least 4 times a year.
            <br/>Since he lost his main function in the network of water conveyance of the City in the 19th century.
            <br/>Manneken-Pis gradually became an image and symbol of the Brussels folklore, the joy of the inhabitants and their capacity of self-mockery.</item>
        <item>The Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium contain collections of around 20,000 paintings, sculptures and drawings, which are preserved and studied.
            <br/>The RMFAB is comprised of several entities: the Musée Old Masters Museum, the Musée Modern Museum, the Musée Wiertz Museum and the Musée Meunier Museum, the Musée Magritte Museum and the new Musée Fin-de-Siècle Museum.
            <br/>The Musée Old Masters Museum houses art works from the 15th to the 18th century.
            <br/>The Museum of Modern Art covers the art from the late 18th century to the present day, mostly Belgian and French painting of the 19th and 20th Centuries.
            <br/>The Musée Wiertz Museum, which has preserved its original atmosphere, is dedicated to painter, sculptor and writer Antoine Wiertz (1806-1865)
            <br/>The Musée Meunier Museum is located at Ixelles in the house-workshop de Constantin Meunier (1831-1905)
            <br/>The Musée Magritte Museum presents an outstanding collection of works by the Belgian Surrealist artist René Magritte.</item>
        <item>The Sablon and the Marolles appear to be two extremes: on the one hand a chic and affluent neighbourhood, and on the other a working class neighbourhood, authentic and a little rough around the edges.
            <br/>Yet both imperceptibly overlap and influence each other.
            <br/>Sablon/Zavel and Marolles/Marollen seem to be the polar opposite of each other: one an elegant and prestigious neighbourhood, the other more down-to-earth, authentic and somewhat down-at-heel.
            <br/>Even so, these neighbourhoods flow into each other unnoticed and influence each other.
            <br/>Sablon/Zavel is a place for antiques, while in Marolles/Marollen the same antiques are on offer at the daily flea market for a song.
            <br/>Sablon/Zavel was once the aristocratic district of Brussels, but the rue Haute/Hoogstraat, which runs directly through the Marolles/Marollen neighbourhood, still holds its own.
            <br/>It already had a certain status in the 16th century.
            <br/>Part of the Marolles/Marollen is still influenced by the Sablon/Zavel: buyers with lots of capital are acquiring empty buildings in rue Blaesstraat or rue Haute/Hoogstraat and turning them into antiques businesses.
            <br/>Parts of Marolles/ Marollen are starting to look more and more like the Sablon/Zavel.</item>
        <item>gallery of the king and princes
            <br/>Conceived in 1837 by Jean-Pierre Cluysenaar, the Royal Galleries Saint-Hubert are inaugurated ten years later by King Leopold I.
            <br/>This monumental passage brings together the Queen\'s Gallery, the King\'s Gallery and the Galerie des Princes.
            <br/>By designing for the first time in the world a passage to the dimensions of the street.
            <br/>Jean-Pierre Cluysenaar has created a place that has become a link between the various functions of the city.
            <br/>Cultural spaces, habitats, shops, offices, restaurants and cafes have been around for more than 150 years.
            <br/>Even today, the Queen\'s, King\'s and Princes\' Galleries are animated by 6 million passers-by-year.
            <br/>The passage is at the same time a microcosm, a place of memory and creation, where past, present and future intertwine inextricably.</item>
