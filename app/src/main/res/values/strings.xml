    <string name="brussels_accommodation_1">You can find a bed in a Brussels hostel for around €17 - €25 per night. There are hostels located 15 minutes walk from the main square, but many are further away. Therefore make sure to look at the map too. Hostel atmosphere is quite friendly and it is a very good place to meet fellow travellers. Many people who travel on their own like to sit in the common room during the evening and chat. Or even plan their sightseeing together.</string>
